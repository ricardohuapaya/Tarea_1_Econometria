## CigarettesB: Cigarette Consumption Data

**Description**: Cross-section data on cigarette consumption for 46 US States, for the year 1992.

**Format**: A data frame containing 46 observations on 3 variables.

**Variables**:

packs: Logarithm of cigarette consumption (in packs) per person of smoking age (> 16 years).

price: Logarithm of real price of cigarette in each state.

income: Logarithm of real disposable income (per capita) in each state.

**Source**: The data are from Baltagi (2002).

## CPS1988: Determinants of Wages Data (CPS 1988)

**Description**: Cross-section data originating from the March 1988 Current Population Survey by the US Census Bureau.

**Format**: A data frame containing 28,155 observations on 7 variables.


**Variables**:

wage: Wage (in dollars per week).

education: Number of years of education.

experience: Number of years of potential work experience.

ethnicity: Factor with levels "cauc" and "afam" (African-American).

smsa: Factor. Does the individual reside in a Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA)?

region: Factor with levels "northeast", "midwest", "south", "west".

parttime: Factor. Does the individual work part-time?

**Details**: A sample of men aged 18 to 70 with positive annual income greater than USD 50 in 1992, who are not self-employed nor working without pay. Wages are deflated by the deflator of Personal Consumption Expenditure for 1992.

A problem with CPS data is that it does not provide actual work experience. It is therefore customary to compute experience as age - education - 6 (as was done by Bierens and Ginther, 2001), this may be considered potential experience. As a result, some respondents have negative experience.

## CPSSW (CPSSWEducation): Stock and Watson CPS Data Sets

**Description**: Stock and Watson (2007) provide several subsets created from March Current Population Surveys (CPS) with data on the relationship of earnings and education over several year.

**Format**
CPSSWEducation: A data frame containing 2,950 observations on 4 variables.

**Variables**:

earnings: average hourly earnings (sum of annual pretax wages, salaries, tips, and bonuses, divided by the number of hours worked annually).

education: number of years of education.

gender: factor indicating gender.

age: age in years.

**Details**:
Each month the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the US Department of Labor conducts the Current Population Survey (CPS), which provides data on labor force characteristics of the population, including the level of employment, unemployment, and earnings. Approximately 65,000 randomly selected US households are surveyed each month. The sample is chosen by randomly selecting addresses from a database. Details can be found in the Handbook of Labor Statistics and is described on the Bureau of Labor Statistics website (http://www.bls.gov/).

The survey conducted each March is more detailed than in other months and asks questions about earnings during the previous year. The data sets contain data for 2004 (from the March 2005 survey), and some also for earlier years (up to 1992).

If education is given, it is for full-time workers, defined as workers employed more than 35 hours per week for at least 48 weeks in the previous year. Data are provided for workers whose highest educational achievement is a high school diploma and a bachelor's degree.

Earnings for years earlier than 2004 were adjusted for inflation by putting them in 2004 USD using the Consumer Price Index (CPI). From 1992 to 2004, the price of the CPI market basket rose by 34.6%. To make earnings in 1992 and 2004 comparable, 1992 earnings are inflated by the amount of overall CPI price inflation, by multiplying 1992 earnings by 1.346 to put them into 2004 dollars.

CPSSW9204 provides the distribution of earnings in the US in 1992 and 2004 for college-educated full-time workers aged 25–34. CPSSW04 is a subset of CPSSW9204 and provides the distribution of earnings in the US in 2004 for college-educated full-time workers aged 25–34. _CPSSWEducation_ is similar (but not a true subset) and contains the distribution of earnings in the US in 2004 for college-educated full-time workers aged 29–30. CPSSW8 contains a larger sample with workers aged 21–64, additionally providing information about the region of residence. CPSSW9298 is similar to CPSSW9204 providing data from 1992 and 1998 (with the 1992 subsets not being exactly identical). CPSSW3 provides trends (from 1992 to 2004) in hourly earnings in the US of working college graduates aged 25–34 (in 2004 USD).

## CreditCard: Expenditure and Default Data

**Description**: Cross-section data on the credit history for a sample of applicants for a type of credit card.

Here, we give the F21.4 version, see the examples for the F9.1 version. Note that age has some suspiciously low values (below one year) for some applicants. One of these differs between the F9.1 and F21.4 version.

## PhDPublications: Doctoral Publications

**Description**: Cross-section data on the scientific productivity of PhD students in biochemistry.

**Format**: A data frame containing 915 observations on 6 variables.

**Variables**:

articles: Number of articles published during last 3 years of PhD.

gender: factor indicating gender.

married: factor. Is the PhD student married?

kids: Number of children less than 6 years old.

prestige: Prestige of the graduate program.

mentor: Number of articles published by student's mentor.

## RecreationDemand: Recreation Demand Data

**Description**: Cross-section data on the number of recreational boating trips to Lake Somerville, Texas, in 1980, based on a survey administered to 2,000 registered leisure boat owners in 23 counties in eastern Texas.

**Format**: A data frame containing 659 observations on 8 variables.

**Variables**:

trips: Number of recreational boating trips.

quality: Facility's subjective quality ranking on a scale of 1 to 5.

ski: factor. Was the individual engaged in water-skiing at the lake?

income: Annual household income of the respondent (in 1,000 USD).

userfee: factor. Did the individual pay an annual user fee at Lake Somerville?

costC: Expenditure when visiting Lake Conroe (in USD).

costS: Expenditure when visiting Lake Somerville (in USD).

costH: Expenditure when visiting Lake Houston (in USD).

**Details**: According to the original source (Seller, Stoll and Chavas, 1985, p. 168), the quality rating is on a scale from 1 to 5 and gives 0 for those who had not visited the lake. This explains the remarkably low mean for this variable, but also suggests that its treatment in various more recent publications is far from ideal. For consistency with other sources we handle the variable as a numerical variable, including the zeros.

# Ejercicios a realizar

1. Para cada conjunto de datos particular, defina una variable de interés como variable a explicar (dependiente). 

2. Defina variables explicativas y realice una regresión lineal (o varias a criterio de los estudiantes y si los datos lo permiten). Haga una interpretación exacta de sus resultados (interpretación de los coeficientes). Note que en ocasiones es mejor utilizar variables en niveles o en logaritmos.

3. Realice las pruebas t para los coeficientes anteriores e interprete su resultado.

4. Realice la prueba F de significancia conjunta del modelo (o modelos) de regresión anterior e interprete su resultado. 

5. Realice múltiples pruebas para medir el cumplimiento de los supuestos de regresión lineal según lo visto en clase (normalidad de los residuos, homocedasticidad, colinealidad, variables instrumentales, entre otros).

6. En caso de no cumplimiento, proponga soluciones según lo visto en clase y estime nuevamente el modelo (o modelos) con dichas correcciones.

7. Finalmente, en caso de no cumplimiento de los supuestos, compare el modelo original con el corregido e interprete esta comparación.

# Fecha y formato de entrega

La fecha de entrega es antes del **23 de Noviembre de 2021**. El formato es un documento auto-reproducible generado desde R (Rmarkdown). Puede ser tipo PDF o HTML según su preferencia. En el título indique "Solución tarea 2" y en el autor el nombre de los integrantes del grupo.

El documento debe incluir el código utilizado, gráficos, texto con las diversas respuestas y tablas de regresiones, preferiblemente con el formato del paquete `stargazer` (type = "html" si es HTML, type = "latex" si es PDF, o type = "text" que siempre funciona en ambos tipos de documento, pero se ve peor). También debe entregar el código de Rmarkdown (archivo con extensión .Rmd) utilizado para generar el documento.
